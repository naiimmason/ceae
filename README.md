# CEAE Willow Projects
These projects use [Willow](http://econwillow.sourceforge.net/), from George Mason University, to produce economic experiments using Python, HTML, and CSS. This repository is for all the code that I will be working on during my Spring internship at the [Center for Experimental and Applie Economics](http://canr.udel.edu/ceae/) at the [University of Delaware](http://udel.edu).

It is important in the development process of applications to track all changes made to the code in case a screw up occurs or someone needs to appraise the development cycle. This README will also have explanations and tutorials on how to run the experiments as they are created.

### Oyseter-Qualtrics
This project is a port of a UD Qualtrics survey to Willow. This allows for more flexibility and control over survey environment and parameters.
