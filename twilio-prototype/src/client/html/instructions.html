      <p>Reporting periods are the first three days of each month: midnight on 1st of the month until midnight on the 3rd of the month. You will receive a text message reminder the night before the reporting period opens and, if you have not yet reported, a text message reminder the morning of the last day of the reporting period. We cannot pay you for reports submitted after the reporting period closes. The payment schedule is described in your invitation letter (if you have lost it, please contact us).</p>

      <p>For each meter, you submit your meter reading each month via a simple text message to 302-543-2859. You just type your seven digit serial number and your six digit meter reading, and separate the serial number and the meter reading by a comma. For example, if my meter serial number is 08-04440 and, this month, my meter reads 999935, I will text: 0804440,999935 (no spaces, no dashes, no periods)</p>

      <p>You will receive immediate confirmation that we received your text, a confirmation of the money you will receive for that report, and the total amount of money received to date. If there is an error in your submission (example: too few digits), you will receive an immediate message asking you to resubmit your report. If you receive a message asking you to resubmit, or if you yourself realize that you made an error and want to re-submit, simply send another text message with the serial number and meter reading. Our system takes the most recent text submitted as the "final report."</p>

      <p>If you prefer to enter your meter readings on a website rather than through text messaging, you can do so here: [whatever will replace <a href="http://jkeeler.me:3100" target="_blank">http://jkeeler.me:3100/</a>]</p>
