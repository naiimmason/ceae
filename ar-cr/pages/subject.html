    <h3><strong><u>Environmental Risk: Experiment Instructions</u></strong></h3>

    <p>TWelcome to an experiment in decision-making.  Throughout the course of this experiment, you will have an opportunity to earn cash.  Please carefully read these instructions and do not communicate with other participants. As stated in the Consent Form, your participation in this experiment is voluntary and you can leave at any time if you wish, however, you would also forego all earnings should you decide to leave the experiment early.</p>

    <p><strong>Part A: Dichotomous Choice</strong></p>

    <p>In the beginning of the experiment, you will be asked a series of Yes/No questions.  These questions will ask whether you are willing to expose yourself to various mixtures of water containing trace amounts of Arsenic Chromium and be <strong><em>paid</em></strong> for doing so.  In essence, we are asking if you will be willing to perform a task for a randomly drawn payment.  These initial <strong><em>six</em></strong> questions will introduce you to the exposure paths of drinking, touching, and inhaling the mixtures mentioned in the consent form.  </p>

    <p>The three exposures are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Submerge hand in randomly drawn mixture of water for 10 seconds</li>

      <li>Breathe in the vapors of a randomly drawn mixture of water for 5 deep breaths</li>

      <li>Drink 2 oz of a randomly drawn mixture of water</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Part B: Demographic Survey</strong></p>

    <p>In this section, we will ask you some questions to identify your demographic.  You have the right to not disclose information you are uncomfortable with sharing.</p>

    <p><strong>Part C: Implementation (6-sided Dice Roll)</strong></p>

    <p>A computer-generated dice roll will be used in this section in order to select one of the six treatments introduced in part A.  If one of the treatments you answered “Yes” to is rolled, an administrator will confirm your decision and you will carry out the respective exposure treatment for the randomly drawn price in addition to a time compensation.  If not, then you will be awarded a time compensation of $15 for participating in the study.</p>

    <p><strong>Part D: Receipt & Payment</strong></p>

    <h3>Arsenic/Chromium-3 Information Treatment</h3>

    <p><strong><u>Arsenic</u>:</strong><br>
    "Absorption of arsenic through the skin is minimal and thus handwashing, 
    bathing, laundry, etc. with water containing arsenic do not ppose human
    health risks."<br>
    (<a href="http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/diseases/arsenicosis/en/"

    </a>)
    </p>

    <p>"Long term exposure (5 to 20 years) to drinking water containing arsenic 
    has been linked to cancer of the bladder, lunks, skin, kidneys, nasal 
    passages, liver, and prostate. Short term exposure to high doses can cause
    other adver health effects, but such effects are unlikely to occur from U.S.
    public water supplies that are in compliance with the arsenic standard."<br>

    <p><strong><u>Chromium</u>:</strong><br>
    "Chromium-3 is nutrionally essential element in humans and is often added to 
    vitamins as a dietary supplement. Chromium-3 has relatively low toxicity and
    would be a concern in drinking water only at very high levels of
    contamination; People who use water containing total chromium in excess of
    the maximum contaminant level (MCL) over many years could experience allergic
    dermatitis."<br>
