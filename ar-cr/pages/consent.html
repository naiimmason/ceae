  <h3>INFORMED CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE IN RESEARCH</h3>

  <p><strong>Title of Project:</strong> Decision-making research concerning perceived environmental risks</p>

  <p><strong>Principal Investigator(s):</strong> Dr. Maik Kecinski and Dr. Kent Messer</p>

  <p><strong>WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY?</strong><br>
  You are invited to participate in a research study about the willingness of people to perform various tasks. The results from this study will help the researchers develop a better understanding of human behavior and may aid policy makers and non-profit organizations. Dr. Maik Kecinski and Dr. Kent Messer at the University of Delaware are conducting this research.</p>

  <p><strong>WHAT WILL YOU BE ASKED TO DO?</strong><br>
  You will encounter a series of questions that you can either choose to accept by selecting YES or decline by selecting NO. The questions you will encounter involve your willingness to expose yourself to water containing certain amounts of heavy metal in exchange for a listed amount of money. There will be three (3) different types of exposures. (1) Submerging of hand for 10 seconds into water that contains a known amount of heavy metal (this information will be provided). (2) Taking three (3) breaths of vapors from water contains a known (this information will be provided) amount of heavy metal. (3) Drink 3 oz. of water that contains a known (this information will be provided) amount of heavy metal. If you do not wish to expose yourself for the listed amount of money, you may decline by simply selecting NO. If you are willing to expose yourself for the listed amount of money you may accept by selecting YES. The research will take approximately 20 minutes.</p>

  <p><strong>WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS?</strong><br>
  Exposure to these waters may cause you discomfort, which is why all exposures will be done in private in a separate room or blocked shielded off area. Should you experience too much discomfort, you may choose not to perform the task and leave at any point. Please communicate this to the administrator. If you choose to exit the research you will still be paid a time compensation of $15.</p>

  <p>The risks you face in this research do not exceed risks you may encounter on a daily basis. The decisions you face in this research and the involved heavy metals in water are smaller than what is considered dangerous daily levels by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and in scientific studies.</p>

  <p><strong>WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS?</strong><br>
  There are no direct benefits to the participants from participating in the research.</p>

  <p><strong>HOW WILL CONFIDENTIALITY BE MAINTAINED? WHO MAY KNOW THAT YOU PARTICIPATED IN THIS RESEARCH?</strong><br>
  As researchers, we have the obligation to protect the confidentiality of the data. The data collected during this research will be kept confidential. Confidentiality involves the promise that research results will not be tied to a person’s name, address, operation, and that no one could reasonably identify a person in a written report.</p>

  <p><strong>WILL YOU RECEIVE ANY COMPENSATION FOR PARTICIPATION?</strong><br>
  We will pay you a $15 time compensation for your participation in today’s research. This time compensation will be paid irrespective of your decisions in the research or whether you decide to exit the research early. Additionally, you will have the chance to earn more money depending on your decisions in the research. YES-decisions in the research will on average earn $15. Therefore, the expected average earnings for all YES-decisions is $30. For some this amount may be slightly lower, while for others it may be dramatically higher, depending on the displayed price per task. The earnings for all NO-decisions is $15.</p>

  <p><strong>DO YOU HAVE TO TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?</strong><br>
  Taking part in this research study is entirely voluntary. You do not have to participate in this research. If you choose to take part, you have the right to stop at any time. If you decide not to participate or if you decide to stop taking part in the research, there will be no penalty and you will still be paid $15 for your participation. However, should you decide to decline participation you will forego the potential earnings from the research tasks. Pregnant women are excluded from taking part in this study.</p>

  <p><strong>WHO SHOULD YOU CALL IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?</strong><br>
  If you have any questions about this study, please contact the Principal Investigator, Dr. Maik Kecinski at (302) 831-4748, kecinski@udel.edu; or Dr. Kent Messer at (302) 831-1316, messer@udel.edu.</p>
