    <h3><b><u>Experiment Instructions</u></b></h3>

    <p>Welcome to an experiment in decision making. In the course of this experiment, you will have several opportunities to earn some cash. Please carefully read these instructions and do not communicate with other participants. As stated in the Consent Form, your participation in this experiment is voluntary and you can leave at any time if you wish.</p>

    <h4><b>Submitting Your Offer</b></h4>
    <p>These instructions will describe several tasks and you will be asked to indicate the minimum amount you would require to be paid, in order to do the task. This amount is referred to as your <u>offer</u>.</p>

    <h4><b>Part A: Eating a piece of chocolate, drawing a picture</b></h4>
    <p>The first task that you will be asked to do is to eat a <u>piece of chocolate</u>. You may be willing to eat the chocolate for no compensation ($0.00) – if this is the case, you would offer $0. If you would rather not eat the chocolate, but would be willing to eat it if we paid you $2, then you would submit an offer of $2. If you really don't want to eat the chocolate, in fact you dislike it so much that we would have to pay you $50 to eat it, you would offer $50. If you refuse to eat the chocolate for any amount less than or equal to $4,999, you can offer $5,000, and you won't have to eat it, no matter what happens.</p>

    <p>Once all the offers for the chocolate have been submitted, we will order all of the offers from the lowest to highest. The person who offered the <u>smallest amount</u> will eat the piece of chocolate, and will receive the <u>second-lowest offer</u>. If multiple people offer the same value, we will randomly determine who gets the chocolate, and the person who gets it will receive the amount they offer. </p>

    <p>You can submit an offer of any amount up to $5,000. However, there is a limit on the maximum compensation we paid. This value has been determined before the start of the session. This limit may be as high as $4,999 and has been chosen randomly for each part of this experiment. The maximum possible compensation is written on a piece of paper in the sealed envelope labeled with today's date at the front of the room. We will ask one of you to draw an envelope and show the limit to everyone at the end of this part of the experiment.</p>

    <p>Consider the following examples.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Participant A offers $1 to eat the chocolate, Participant B offers $2 to eat the chocolate, Participant C offers $3 to eat the chocolate and the sealed envelope amount is $30. In this case, Participant A will eat the chocolate and receive $2. Everyone else would not eat anything nor be paid any money.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Participant A offers $1, Participant B offers $2, Participant C is willing to eat the chocolate for zero compensation and offers $0 and the sealed envelope is $100. In this case, Participant C would eat the chocolate and be paid $1. Everyone else would not eat anything nor be paid any money.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Participant A offers $5, Participant B is unwilling to eat the chocolate for $4,999 or less and offers $5,000, Participant C also offers $5,000 and the sealed envelope amount is $4. In this case, no one would eat the chocolate nor be paid any money, because the lowest offer is higher than the sealed envelope amount.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Participant A offers $5, Participant B offers $5, Participant C is unwilling to eat the chocolate for $4,999 or less and offers $5,000 and the sealed envelope amount is $10. In this case, a random draw between Participant A and Participant B would determine the winner. The winner would eat the chocolate and receive $5. Everyone else would not eat anything nor be paid any money.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Participant A offers $5, Participant B is unwilling to eat the chocolate for $4,999 or less and offers $5,000, Participant C offers $15 to eat the chocolate and the sealed envelope amount is $10. Participant A would eat the chocolate and be paid $10. Everyone else would not eat anything nor be paid any money.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The second task that you will be asked to do is to <u>draw a picture</u> using the pen and blank sheet of paper on your desk. You may be willing to draw the picture for no compensation ($0) – if this is the case, you would offer $0. If you would rather not draw the picture, but would be willing to do so if we paid you $10, you would offer $10. If you really don't like drawing pictures, in fact you dislike it so much that we would have to pay you $50 to draw a picture, you would offer $50. If you refuse to draw a picture for any amount less than or equal to $4,999, you can offer $5,000, and you won't have to draw anything, no matter what happens.</p>
