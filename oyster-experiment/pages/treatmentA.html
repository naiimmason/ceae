  <li>Nutrients, such as Nitrogen and Phosphorous, are naturally occurring elements that are essential for growth and reproduction in both plants and animals.</li>
  <li>Excess levels of nutrients, however, can cause overstimulation of growth of aquatic plants and algae, leading to algal blooms, oxygen depletion, clogged water intakes, fish kills, a general loss of key habitats, and affect the use of water for fishing, swimming, and boating.</li>
  <li>Oysters are filter feeders, consuming free-swimming algae and improve water quality.</li>
  <li>New research from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) supports using shellfish aquaculture for nutrient removal.</li>
