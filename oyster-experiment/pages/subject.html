    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <p><em>Please read these instructions carefully and do not communicate with any one during the experiment. Ask a facilitator if you have a question and remember that your participation is voluntary.</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>We will give you $10 that you may keep and/or use to purchase oysters.</strong> You may think of this money as a bank account from which you can withdrawal money.</li>
      <li>Depending on the choices you select during the experiment, you may receive oysters and cash; cash only; oysters only; or oysters and you owe money at the end of the experiment.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h3>Rules:</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Decide how many oysters you want to play for (3, 6, 9 or 12)</li>
      <li>Decide if you want to buy the oyster options at the random price by selecting “Yes” or “No”</li>
      <li>Roll a die to determine which oyster option will be implemented</li>
      <li>Fill out a short survey</li>
    </ol>

    <br>

    <ul><li>You may consume the oysters (a) raw on the half shell, (b) raw in a shot glass, fried as a 'po-boy’ sandwich, or take them home in a bag.</li></ul>

    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> If you selected 'Yes’ for an oyster bundle that cost $7 and this decision was implemented, you will receive the oysters and $3 cash ($10 - $7 = $3).</p>

    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> If you selected 'No’ for an oyster bundle and this decision was implemented, you will receive $10 and will not receive any oysters.</p>

    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> If you selected 'Yes’ for an oyster bundle that cost $15 and this decision was implemented, you will receive the oysters and owe $5 cash ($10 - $15 = -$5).</p>
